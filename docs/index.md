# Welcome

A Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Extension Proposal (BEP) is
  a community-driven process to add a new modality or set of data types to
  the [BIDS Specification][specification].

This site provides information about creating, working with, and learning more about
  BIDS Extension Proposals (more commonly referred to as BEP or in the plural as BEPs).

## BEP Guide

For information about what is a BEP and how to get started working with a BEP visit the [BEP Guide](guide.md).

**Make sure you have explored the [specification]
  and the [BEP lists](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification)
  to find existing or ongoing efforts that may support what you
  are trying to add into the BIDS Specification. That is to say,
  "not everything in research needs to be replicated".**

## Submitting a BEP

Once you've made progress on your BEP and you are ready to integrate it into the
  specification visit the [BEP Submission Guide](submission.md).

## The BIDS Schema

This site also serves as the main documentation repository for working with the BIDS Schema,
  which you will need to enable validation of your BEP.
  For more information about the history of, working with, and
  translating your BEP into the schema visit the [Schema Guide](schema.md) on this site.
