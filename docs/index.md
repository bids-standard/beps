# Welcome

This site is here to provide information about creating, working with, or learning about the history of BIDS Extension Proposals.
Firstly, BIDS Extension proposals are more commonly refered to by the acronym BEP or in the plural as BEP's.

## BEP Guide

For information about what is a BEP and how to get started working with a BEP visit the [BEP Guide](guide.md).

**_We strongly suggest that you explore the [specification](bids-specification.readthedocs.io) 
and the [lists](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification) 
linked [here](#what-is-a-bids-extension-proposal-(bep)) to find existing or ongoing efforts that may support what you
are trying to add into the BIDS Specification._**

## Submitting a BEP

Once you've made progress on your BEP and you are ready to integrated it into the spec visit the [BEP Submission Guide](submission.md).

## The BIDS Schema

Additionally, this site serves as the main documentation repository for working with the BIDS Schema, which you will 
encounter as a part of creating a BEP. For more information about the history of, working with, or 
translating your BEP into the schema visit the [Schema Guide](schema.md) on this site.
